# Lizard-Spock
A console version of the classic rock-paper-scissors game, originally made popular by the Big Bang Theory tv show. Built entirely using Python 3. 

## Three versions
There are three versions of this game, starting with Game 1, which is the most basic. Game 2 is a bit more advanced, and Game 3 is the final form (for now!).
